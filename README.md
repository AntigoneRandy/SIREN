# SIREN
Official Implementation for "Towards Reliable Verification of Unauthorized Data Usage in Personalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Models" (IEEE S&amp;P 2025).

We are currently sorting out our code, which may take 3~5 months to complete. Please email Boheng Li (randy.bh.li@foxmail.com) if you have questions on implementation details. We have closed the issue panel and will open it again upon we release our code to avoid questions on code releasing time.
